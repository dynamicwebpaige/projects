-----------------------------------------

### üó£ Notable recent conference talks:
* **[Deep Fashion: A Totally Rad Introduction to Transfer Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl1QeOMwe-A)** (Anaconda Con, April 2018)
* **[Kill (Deep) Math!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5ae9SejRh4)** (ML4ALL, May 28, 2018)
* **[BUILD 2018 Azure Keynote: Azure DataBricks and Azure Cognitive Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5ae9SejRh4)** (May 2018)
 
The first is an end-to-end machine learning case study: building a model, containerizing it, and then deploying it with Azure Model Management + calling it as a REST API. The second is an exploration of the mathematics required to implement a neural network. The final example is two quick demos for Build 2018 - one on Azure Cognitive Search, one on Azure DataBricks.
 
- _Attendees for the first two:_ ~100; 
- _Attendees for the third:_ 6000 in-person, 500k live-streamed, >2M in all.

-----------------------------------------

### üìä [Digital Signal Processing with R](http://signalsand.systems)
Examples were generated in RMarkdown. The textbook are figures and code to support an open-source DSP textbook from Richard Baraniuk; the other are examples for an R package.

-----------------------------------------

### üë©‚Äçüè´ [Coursework for the Coursera study group I led at Chevron.](http://calculated.solutions/coursera)
I was also selected to serve as a mentor for the Chevron Data Science Development Program - an elite group of prospective data scientists, mostly coming from the internal research group. Almost all of my pupils had PhDs - which was a tad bit surreal, but very fun!
 
[In-progress examples of R code to supplement open-source statistics textbooks.](http://calculated.solutions/stats.html)

-----------------------------------------

### üíª [Links to resources used for BUILD talks](https://notebooks.azure.com/dynamicwebpaige/libraries/mvpsummit-1)
Four this year: two on DevOps for Data Science, one on Machine Learning at Scale, and an Introduction to Tensorflow with Keras.

-----------------------------------------

### üíæ [GitHub contributions](https://github.com/dynamicwebpaige?tab=repositories)
Mostly documentation, especially Azure documentation - but you'll also see ethical modeling guidelines, a few NASA Space Math examples, and machine learning code snippets for VS Code. Have also added minor changes to docs for Magenta, TensorBoard, TensorFlow, and Keras.

-----------------------------------------

### ‚öñ [Proxy Bias Vignette with R](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/06/understanding-bias.html)
Created during the rOpenSci Unconference; was invited to attend by the good folks at numFOCUS. It was a heck of a lot of fun!

-----------------------------------------

### üöõ [DeepParking: Microsoft One Week Hackathon 2018](https://github.com/DeepParking/DeepParking)
A mobile application that directs Microsoft employees to the closest vacant parking spot in Building 43, based on vehicle type. Uses YOLO to detect cars parked in spaces.

-----------------------------------------

### üê§ Some examples of Twitter rants:

* [Code samples in less than 280 characters](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/928101793971699712)
 
* [Jupyter Notebook extension of the day](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/984305155783909376)
 
* [Communicating complex topics + building an open-source community](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/945702102214594560)
 
* [Why there is often a disconnect between SWEs and data scientists](https://twitter.com/i/moments/937075112343371777)
 
* [Common statistics mistakes when practicing data analysis](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/1045181095518654464)
 
I, uh, also resuscitate Apple IIs and had a small LLC for wearable electronics for a bit ([electricute.me](http://electricute.me)). üòä
