# ⏳ @DynamicWebPaige: _BUILDING..._

👋 Howdy!
 
Below are some more or less helpful resources for understanding what I've been doing with my life over the last few years. 

-----------------------------------------

### 🗣 Notable recent conference talks:
* **[Deep Fashion: A Totally Rad Introduction to Transfer Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl1QeOMwe-A)** (Anaconda Con, April 2018)
* **[Kill (Deep) Math!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5ae9SejRh4)** (ML4ALL, May 28, 2018)
* **[BUILD 2018 Azure Keynote: Azure DataBricks and Azure Cognitive Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5ae9SejRh4)** (May 2018)
 
The first is an end-to-end machine learning case study: building a model, containerizing it, and then deploying it with Azure Model Management + calling it as a REST API. The second is an exploration of the mathematics required to implement a neural network. The final example are two quick demos for Build 2018 - one on Azure Cognitive Search, one on Azure DataBricks.
 
- _Attendees for the first two:_ ~100; 
- _Attendees for the third:_ 6000 in-person, 500k live-streamed, >2M in all.

### 📊 Digital Signal Processing with R 
Examples were generated in RMarkdown. The textbook are figures and code to support an open-source DSP textbook from Richard Baraniuk; the other are examples for an R package.

### 👩‍🏫 Coursework for the Coursera study group I led at Chevron. 
I was also selected to serve as a mentor for the Chevron Data Science Development Program - an elite group of prospective data scientists, mostly coming from the internal research group. Almost all of my pupils had PhDs - which was a tad bit surreal, but very fun!

In-progress examples of R code to supplement open-source statistics textbooks:

### 💻 Links to resources used for BUILD talks:
Four this year: two on DevOps for Data Science, one on Machine Learning at Scale, and an Introduction to Tensorflow with Keras.

### 💾 GitHub contributions
Mostly documentation, especially Azure documentation - but you'll also see ethical modeling guidelines, a few NASA Space Math examples, and machine learning code snippets for VS Code. Have also added minor changes to docs for Magenta, TensorBoard, TensorFlow, and Keras.

### ⚖ Proxy Bias Vignette with R
Created during the rOpenSci Unconference; was invited to attend by the good folks at numFOCUS. It was a heck of a lot of fun!

### 🚛 DeepParking: Microsoft One Week Hackathon 2018
A mobile application that directs Microsoft employees to the closest vacant parking spot in Building 43, based on vehicle type. Uses YOLO to detect cars parked in spaces.

* Communicating complex topics + building an open-source community:

* Common statistics mistakes when practicing data analysis

I, uh, also resuscitate Apple IIs and had a small LLC for wearable machine learning for a bit ([](http://electricute.me)). 😊
